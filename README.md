# Spotify Data Analysis and Exploration

This is the final project repository for the course INFX 547 A: Social Media Data Mining and Analysis.

Our work primarily involved conducting research on music data, raising questions about them, and answering those questions via data collection, analysis, and visualization based on self-collected Spotify data.

Contributor: Yu Wang, Wuyi Zhang, and Tapasvi Bansal

This is Dimension, a fun little one-pager with modal-ized (is that a word?) "pages"
and a cool depth effect (click on a menu item to see what I mean). Simple, fully
responsive, and kitted out with all the usual pre-styled elements you'd expect.
Hope you dig it :)
