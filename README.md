# Spotify Data Analysis and Exploration

Contributor: Yu Wang, Wuyi Zhang, and Tapasvi Bansal

This repository is for the course INFX 547 A: Social Media Data Mining and Analysis.

Our work primarily focus on conducting reserach on music data, raising questions on them, and answer those questions via data collection, data analysis, and data visualization based on open Spotify data.

This is Dimension, a fun little one-pager with modal-ized (is that a word?) "pages"
and a cool depth effect (click on a menu item to see what I mean). Simple, fully
responsive, and kitted out with all the usual pre-styled elements you'd expect.
Hope you dig it :)
